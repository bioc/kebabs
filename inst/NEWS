Change history of package kebabs:
====================================

Version 1.0.4
- change in LiblineaR - upgrade to LIBLINEAR 1.94
  in function LiblineaR the parameter labels was renamed to target
- correction in model selection for performance parameters
- minor changes in help pages
- minor changes in vignette

Version 1.0.3
- extension of function linearKernel to optionally return
  a sparse kernel matrix
- new accessor SVindex for class KBModel
- error correction in subsetting of sparse explicit representation for
  head / tail
- error correction of vector length overflow in sparse explicit
  representation for very large number of sequences in spectrum,
  gappy pair and motif kernel
- error correction for training with position specific kernel and
  computation of feature weights
- error correction in coercion of kernel to character for distance
  weighting
- error correction in subsetting of prediction profile
- error correction in spectrum, gappy pair and motif kernel
  for kernel matrix - last feature was missing in kernel value
  in rare situations
- error correction and minor C code changes for
  mismatch kernel
- check uniqueness of motifs in motif kernel
- build warnings on Windows removed
- minor changes in help pages
- change name of vignette Rnw to lowercase
- minor changes in vignette

Version 1.0.2
- correction of MCC
- correction of computation of feature weights for
  LiblineaR with more than 3 classes

Version 1.0.1
- correction for cross validation with factor label
- correction for storing prob model in kebabs model for kernlab
- removal of clang warnings for unused functions

Version 1.0.0:
- first official release as part of Bioconductor 3.0
