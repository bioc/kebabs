\description{
BioVector, DNAVector, RNAVector and AAVector Classes
}
\details{
This class is the parent class for representing sets of
biological sequences with support of lowercase characters.
The derived classes \code{\linkS4class{DNAVector}},
\code{\linkS4class{RNAVector}} and
\code{\linkS4class{AAVector}} hold DNA-, RNA- or
AA-sequences which can contain also lowercase characters.
In many cases repeat regions are coded as lowercase
characters and with the \code{\linkS4class{BioVector}}
based classes sequence analysis with and without repeat
regions can be performed from the same sequence set.
Whenever lowercase is not needed please use the
\code{\linkS4class{XStringSet}} based classes as they
provide much richer functionality. The class
\code{BioVector }is derived from "character" and holds the
sequence information as character vector. Interfaces for
the small set of functions needed in KeBABS are designed
consistent with \code{\linkS4class{XStringSet}}.

Instances of the \code{DNAVector} class are used for
representing sets of DNA sequences.

Instances of the \code{RNAVector} class are used for
representing sets of RNA sequences.

Instances of the \code{AAVector} class are used for
representing sets of amino acid sequences.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{NAMES}}{sequence names}

\item{\code{elementMetadata}}{element metadata, which is applicable per element
and holds a DataTable with one entry per sequence in each column.
KeBABS uses the column names "annotation" and "offset".}

\item{\code{metadata}}{metadata applicable for the entire sequence set as list.
      KeBABS stores the annotation character set as list element
      named "annotationCharset".}
