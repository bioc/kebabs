\format{TFBS contains the 259 positive and 241 negative sequences as
DNAStringSet and the corresponding labels as numeric vector containing a
value of 1 for positive and -1 for negative samples.

CCoil contains the 477 AA sequences as AAStringSet and the corresponding
labels as factor. The heptad anntoation is stored as character vector and
group assignment as numeric vector.}

\description{
The package contains two small sequence datasets for
demonstration of the package functionality.\cr\cr TFBS is a
subset of EP300/CREBBP binding data provided with the
publication Lee et al., 2011. The data is based on binding
sites identified with ChIP-seq by Visel et al., 2009.
Please note that due to package size restrictions only a
small subset of the data used in Lee et al., 2011 is
included in the package. Following variables are
defined:\cr\cr \itemize{ \item \code{enhancerFB} contains
259 DNA sequences of tissue specific enhancers from
embryonic day 11.5 mouse embryos and 241 negative sequences
sampled from mm9 genome. \item \code{yFB} contains the
associated labels } CCoil is a set of heptad-annotated
amino acid sequences of coiled coil proteins forming dimers
or trimers from the web site of the package \bold{PrOCoil}
by Mahrenholz et. al., 2011. The data contains the
sequences with heptad annotation, the oligomerization state
and group assignment for each sequence. The grouping was
performed through single linkage clustering of sequence
similarities based on pairwise ungapped alignment.
Following variables are defined:\cr\cr \itemize{ \item
\code{ccseq} contains 477 AA sequences of heptad-annotated
amino acid sequences with a minimum length of 8 and a
maximun length of 123 AAs. \item \code{yCC} contains the
associated oligomerization state "DIMER" or "TRIMER". \item
\code{ccannot} is a charcter vector with the heptad
annotations for the sequences. Characters 'a' to 'f'
represent specific positions within the coiled coil
structure. The AA string set already contains the
annotation as metadata. But for demonstration purpose it is
available as separate data item. \item \code{ccgroups} is a
numeric vector containing the group numbers of of the
sequences. }
