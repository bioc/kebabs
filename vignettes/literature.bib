@article{Hochreiter2006,
	Abstract = {We describe a new technique for the analysis of
                  dyadic data, where two sets of objects (row and
                  column objects) are characterized by a matrix of
                  numerical values that describe their mutual
                  relationships.  The new technique, called potential
                  support vector machine (P-SVM), is a large-margin
                  method for the construction of classifiers and
                  regression functions for the column
                  objects. Contrary to standard support vector machine
                  approaches, the P-SVM minimizes a scale-invariant
                  capacity measure and requires a new set of
                  constraints. As a result, the P-SVM method leads to
                  a usually sparse expansion of the classification and
                  regression functions in terms of the row rather than
                  the column objects and can handle data and kernel
                  matrices that are neither positive definite nor
                  square. We then describe two complementary
                  regularization schemes. The first scheme improves
                  generalization performance for classification and
                  regression tasks; the second scheme leads to the
                  selection of a small, informative set of row support
                  objects and can be applied to feature
                  selection. Benchmarks for classification,
                  regression, and feature selection tasks are
                  performed with toy data as well as with several
                  real-world data sets. The results show that the new
                  method is at least competitive with but often
                  performs better than the benchmarked standard
                  methods for standard vectorial as well as true
                  dyadic data sets. In addition, a theoretical
                  justification is provided for the new approach.},

@article{Visel2009,
	Abstract = {{A major yet unresolved quest in decoding the human genome is the identification of the regulatory sequences that control the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Distant-acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non-coding portion of the genome. Evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo. Here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation with the enhancer-associated protein p300 followed by massively parallel sequencing, and map several thousand in vivo binding sites of p300 in mouse embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue. We tested 86 of these sequences in a transgenic mouse assay, which in nearly all cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity in the tissues that were predicted by p300 binding. Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding is a highly accurate means for identifying enhancers and their associated activities, and suggest that such data sets will be useful to study the role of tissue-specific enhancers in human biology and disease on a genome-wide scale.}},
